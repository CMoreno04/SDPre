    <h2><strong>What is the difference between ‘switch’ and ‘if/else’? When would you use one versus the other?</strong></h2>

        <p>The difference is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>"Switch" will switch the users input with another variable declared (double, int or String).</li>
        <li>On the other hand, "If / Else" will have some parameters. If the the parameter is accomplished then run first option, else consider this other parameter and run.</li>
      </ul>

    <h5><strong>When it comes to methods, what is the difference between a “parameter” and an “argument”? Is there one? When would you use one versus the other?</strong></h5>
    <p>
      <p>The difference is:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Parameters are contained in the method definition.</li>
        <li>Arguments are passed into a methods parameters. </li>

    <h6><strong>When you get frustrated and discouraged what do you do? How can you keep your confidence up and encourage yourself during the program?</strong></h6>
    <p>Usually I  take a break, clear my head of whatever makes me frustrated, listen to music or play a game. This helps me to bring new ideas and perspective into mind. I'll keep myself engaged with discipline, a good routine and acknowledge when help is needed.</p>
